# Moody-Player 🎵  

## Description  
Moody-Player is a full-stack music player application (frontend + backend) allowing users to browse, play, and manage music. It provides a seamless, modern web interface and a backend API for music streaming / management.  

This project aims to deliver a clean, intuitive UI and robust backend — bridging the gap between easy-to-use frontend and powerful server-side functionality.  

## Features  
- User-friendly web UI (frontend) for browsing and playing music  
- Backend API for serving music files / metadata (via REST or other API)  
- Supports various music file types / playlists (as implemented)  
- (You can list your implemented features here — e.g. search, playlists, authentication, etc.)  

## Tech Stack / Architecture  
- Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript  (plus any frontend framework you use)  
- Backend: Node.js / Express (or relevant backend stack)  
- Project structure:  
  - `frontend/` — code for UI  
  - `backend/` — server-side code / API
